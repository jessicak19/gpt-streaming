# Implemented for OpenAI GPT-4 with Streaming Responses 

Chatbot using GPT-4 which assists Scratch users in creating and brainstorming Scratch projects.
Presented and tested during Generative AI discussion group at MIT Media Lab
To be implemented into Scratch interface, complete with image detection/ scanning abilities to scan Scratch environment to help users. 

Scratch Chat - I programmed prototype blocks for Scratch with added chatGPT-4 functionality, including blocks that set and update the system prompt and have pre-filled “choose options” among others, and worked on both frontend and backend developments. I also created an extension chatbot using GPT-4 which helps users brainstorm project ideas or helps troubleshoot errors in their projects, fine-tuning the openAI model through multiple rounds of prompt engineering. 

_extensions for AI chatbots and image generation to add text/image features to Scratch platform such as system prompt presets and Controlnet versions. Front-end and backend developer using Github, Javascript, React.
